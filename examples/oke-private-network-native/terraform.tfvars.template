# GETTING STARTED
#
# 1. Download and install TerraForm (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
# 2. Download and install the OCI TerraForm provider (https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/)
# 3. Make sure that you have an OCI API key setup
#       See https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm for directions on creating an API signing key
#       See https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm on how to manage API keys in the OCI UI or API
# 4. Copy your tenancy OCID below (bottom part of OCI screen, after Tenancy OCID: heading)
# 5. Copy your OCI user account OCID (login to OCI > Identity > Users)
# 6. Copy the required API key fingerprint and private key path (below)
# 7. Fill-in the full path to the SSH public and private keys (this can be used when creating new instances)
#       See https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Tasks/creatingkeys.htm for directions on how to create this key pair

# RUNNING TerraForm
#
# Once you've gone through the steps mentioned above, you need to populate your environment variables, by sourcing this file... steps are below:
# 1. Modify this file (so it reflects your OCIDs, etc.)
# 2. $ terraform init
#       You only have to do this once after installing or upgrading your TerraForm plugins
# 3. $ terraform plan
#       This will show you what TerraForm might do if you applied it
# 4. $ terraform apply

# Get this from the bottom of the OCI screen (after logging in, after Tenancy ID: heading)
tenancy_ocid="<tenancy OCID"
# Get this from OCI > Identity > Users (for your user account)
user_ocid="<user OCID>"

# the fingerprint can be gathered from your user account (OCI > Identity > Users > click your username > API Keys fingerprint (select it, copy it and paste it below))
fingerprint="<PEM key fingerprint>"
# this is the full path on your local system to the private key used for the API key pair
private_key_path="<path to the private key that matches the fingerprint above>"

# region (us-phoenix-1, ca-toronto-1, etc)
region="<your region>"
